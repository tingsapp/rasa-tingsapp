After scheduling your move, you can communicate directly with your movers through our app. On moving day, they'll show up at the scheduled time and move your stuff to your new place. Once the job is complete, you'll be notified of any comments and have the option to leave a tip for your movers."
  utter_cost:
    - text: "The cost of a move depends on factors such as the size of the move, distance, time spent loading and unloading, and if there are stairs involved."

  utter_unmoved_items:
    - text: "We're happy to help you move most household items that can be handled by two people. However, for safety and liability reasons, there are a few things we're unable to move. This includes items such as pianos, organs, safes, jukeboxes, kegs and alcohol, pool tables, live animals, and anything that needs to be hoisted over a balcony."
  utter_movers:
    - text: "Movers are independent contractors. All the movers are hand-picked and background-checked to ensure the quality of service they provide."

  utter_disassemble_assemble:

  utter_equipment:
    - text: "All movers are equipped with furniture dollies, moving blankets, tie-downs, straps, and plastic wraps as well as a basic toolkit for moves that require assembly or breakdown."

  utter_change_order:
    - text: "On the Tingsapp website or mobile application, go to My moves and provide the phone number used while placing the order. After verification, you will be directed to your order. Under the detail of your specific order, you have the option to edit or cancel your order."
  utter_cancel_move:
    - text: "Yes, you can cancel your order for free up to 24 hours before the scheduled date. However, if you cancel within 24 hours of the scheduled time, there will be a 20% cancellation fee based on the total cost. If your movers have already arrived at the first location and cannot complete the move due to reasons outside of their control or due to rescheduling or cancellation, a 50% cancellation fee will apply."
  utter_operation_hours:
    - text: "Tingsapp is available 24/7 for bookings, but movers can only be scheduled during business hours from Monday to Sunday."
  utter_payment_time:
    - text: "When you place an order, there will be a nominal hold on your credit card, and the total amount will be charged after the move is completed."
